    abstract = {Electric guitar playing is ubiquitous in practically all modern music genres. In the hands of an experienced player, electric guitars can sound as expressive and distinct as a human voice. Unlike other more quantised instruments where pitch is a discrete function, guitarists can incorporate micro-tonality and, as a result, vibrato and sting-bending are idiosyncratic hallmarks of a player. Similarly, a wide variety of techniques unique to the electric guitar have emerged. While the mechano-acoustics of stringed instruments and vibrating strings are well studied, there has been comparatively little work dedicated to the underlying physics of unique electric guitar techniques and strings, nor the mechanical factors influencing vibrato, string-bending, fretting force and whammy-bar dynamics. In this work, models for these processes are derived and the implications for guitar and string design discussed. The string-bending model is experimentally validated using a variety of strings and vibrato dynamics are simulated. The implications of these findings on the configuration and design of guitars is also discussed.},

    abstract = {The physics of wound and unwound strings on the electric guitar are presented here, and the pitch intervals produced by the movements of a Fender Stratocaster tremolo unit are explained. Predicted changes in pitch sensitivity of different strings are given, and experimentally verified, for changes in saddle height, the distance of string free to move behind the nut and ratio of diameters/masses of the core and windings of wound strings. Also, it is shown that changes to the gauge of strings (assuming the string tension is sufficient for linear behaviour and in absence of changes to other construction details) don't alter the pitch intervals produced by a given angle of tremolo arm use assuming the instrument is set up with the same sounding pitches and starting bridge angle. It is demonstrated that it not possible to equalise the relative sensitivity of unwound steel stings on a Fender Stratocaster type tremolo unit through string construction techniques. The ratio of core to winding mass in the string, on the other hand, was found to be a very powerful design parameter for choosing the sensitivity of the string to tremolo arm use and standard pitch bends. For instance, the pitch intervals produced by operation of tremolo arm for wound strings may be made to approximately match that for one of the unwound strings if they share very similar core gauges (assuming the winding masses are chosen to give approximately the same tension at their sounding pitches). Such a design, only available currently by custom order, also delivers the optimum equalisation in sensitivity of strings for standard string bends (due to these also being produced by altering the length of the string to generate changes in tension and therefore pitch).},

This process is accounted for on the basis of a quasi-linear viscoelastic theory. A nonlinear modified constitutive equation for the viscoelastic medium is deduced. In processing the experimental data it turned out to be necessary to keep the nonlinear terms up to cubic in the constitutive equation for nylon fiber.

For linear vibration in a single polarisation, the most common model is based on the Euler–Bernoulli beam equation under tension. In spite of its simple form, such a model gives unbounded phase and group velocities at large wavenumbers, and such behaviour may be interpreted as unphysical. The Timoshenko model has, therefore, been employed in more recent works to overcome such shortcoming. This paper presents a third model based on the shear beam equations. The three models are here assessed and compared with regard to the perceptual considerations in musical acoustics.}",

Our research has investigated how various physical properties of the guitar affect its timbre. We have investigated the effects of (a) string excitement location, (b) string type and gauge, (c) pick versus pluck excitement, and (e) the placement of a capo on an acoustic guitar. The main goal is to investigate how each of these factors play a role in certain genres of music where guitars are one of the main instruments. Measurements were taken at the LU acoustics lab and the anechoic chamber at Northwestern. This talk will present theoretical basis for our measurements and discuss the effects of the pick versus pluck and placing a capo on the neck of the guitar. The following talk will discuss the remaining factors and how our study contributes to the capability of the player to create different moods.}",

By varying the source signal, a nearly unlimited number of unique tones can be produced using a given filter model. However, it as unclear as to how exactly the model excitation signals should be parameterized in order to capture the nuances of a guitarist's articulation from a recorded performance. In this paper, we apply principal components analysis to a corpus of excitation signals derived from plucked-guitar recordings in order to design a codebook that captures the unique characteristics of certain string articulations. The development of an excitation codebook has several applications, including expressive synthesis of guitar tones for virtual music interfaces and insight into the expressive intentions of a performer through audio analysis.},

abstract = {Computer Music Journal Computer Music Journal, 25:3, pp. 38–49, Fall 2001 © 2001 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Sound synthesis based on physical modeling of stringed instruments has been an active research field for the last decade. The most efficient synthesis models have been obtained using the theory of digital waveguides (Smith 1992). Commuted waveguide synthesis (Smith 1993; Karjalainen et al. 1993) is based on the linearity and time-invariance of the synthesis model and is an important method for developing a generic string instrument model. Recently, such a model has been presented including consolidated pluck and body wavetables, a pluck-shaping filter, a pluck-position comb filter, string models with loop filters and continuously variable delays, and sympathetic couplings between the strings (Karjalainen et al. 1998). Our model is realized in a real-time software synthesizer called PWSynth. PWSynth is a user library for PatchWork (Laurson 1996) that attempts to effectively integrate computer-assisted composition and sound synthesis. PWSynth is a part of our project that investigates different control strategies for physical models of musical instruments. PatchWork is used also to generate control data from an extended score representation, the Expressive Notation Package (ENP) (Laurson et al. 1999; Kuuskankare and Laurson 2000; Laurson 2000). Calibration of the synthesis model is based on the analysis of recorded guitar tones (Välimäki et al. 1996; Tolonen 1998). A recent article (Erkut et al. 2000) addressed the revision of the calibration process to improve efficiency and robustness. It also proposed extended methods to capture information about performance characteristics such as different pluck styles, vibrato, and dynamic variations of a professional player. In addition, the article presented basic techniques for simulation of the transients. Instead of using a detailed finger–string interaction model like that proposed by Cuzzucoli and Lombardo (1999), the simulation consolidates all the transient effects into the excitation signal and the update trajectories of the model parameters. The current article summarizes our achievements in model-based sound synthesis of the acoustic guitar with improved realism. First, a simplified physical model of a string instrument realized in our work is described. The next section discusses the calibration of the synthesis model. Then, we address controlling the synthesizer using ENP. After this, we provide an overview of the real-time synthesizer PWSynth. The final section discusses how we simulate various playing styles used in the classical guitar repertoire. Musical excerpts related to this article will be included on the forthcoming Computer Music Journal 25:4 compact disc.},

abstract = {Using recent developments in music theory, which are generalizations of the well-known properties of the familiar 12-tone, equal-tempered musical scale, an approach is described for constructing equal-tempered musical scales (with "diatonic" scales and the associated chord structure) based on good-fitting intervals and a generalization of the modulation properties of the circle of fifths. An analysis of the usual 12-tone equal-tempered system is provided as a vehicle to introduce the mathematical details of these recent music-theoretic developments and to articulate the approach for constructing musical scales. The formalism is extended to describe equal-tempered musical scales with nonoctave closure. Application of the formalism to a system with closure at an octave plus a perfect fifth generates the Bohlen-Pierce scale originally developed for harmonic properties similar to traditional chords but without the perceptual biases of these familiar chords. Subsequently, the formalism is applied to the group-theory-based 20-fold microtonal system of Balzano. It is shown that with an appropriate choice of nonoctave closure (6:1 in this case), determined by the formalism combined with continued fraction analysis, that this group-theoretic-generated system may be interpreted in terms of the frequency ratios 21:56:88:126. Although contrary to the spirit of the group-theoretic approach to generating scales, this analysis may be applicable for discovering the ratio basis of unusual tunings common in non-Western music.},

abstract = {1. INTRODUCTION The history of musical instruments goes back tens of thousands of years. Fragments of bone flutes and whistles have been found at Neanderthal sites. Recently, a 9,000-year-old flute found in China was shown to be the world’s oldest playable instrument (pictures and a recording of this flute are available at http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/flutes.html). These early instruments show that people have long been concerned with producing pitched sound—that is, sound containing predominantly a single frequency. Indeed, finger holes on the flutes indicate that these prehistoric musicians had some concept of a musical scale. The study of the mathematics of musical instruments dates back at least to the Pythagoreans, who discovered that certain combinations of pitches that they considered pleasing corresponded to simple ratios of frequencies such as 2:1 and 3:2. The problems of tuning, temperament, and acoustics have since occupied some the brightest minds in the natural sciences. Marin Marsenne’s treatise on tuning and acoustics Harmonie Universelle (1636) [19], H. v. Helmholtz’s On the Sensations of Tone (1870) [15], and Lord Rayleigh’s seminal The Theory of Sound (1877) [21 ]a re just three outstanding examples. Many pages have been written on this subject. We mean to present an overview and let the interested reader find more detailed discussions in the references, and on our web site www.sju.edu/∼rhall/newton. 2. THE WILLOW FLUTE In this section we consider the physical properties of a Norwegian folk flute called the seljefloyte, or willow flute. This instrument can be considered “primitive” in that it does not rely on finger holes to produce different pitches. Rather, by varying the strength with which he or she blows into the flute, the player selects from a series of pitches called harmonics, whose frequencies are integer multiples of the flute’s lowest tone, called the fundamental. The willow flute’s scale is approximately a major scale with a sharp fourth and flat sixth, and plus a flat seventh. The willow flute is a member of the recorder family, though it is held transversally. The flute is constructed from a hollow willow branch (or, more recently, a PVC pipe; see the quirky but informative web site http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Museum/},

We define six measurements to determine the closeness of scales generated by pure intervals to equal-tempered scales. Two measures apply to scales generated by single intervals and rely heavily on continued fraction analysis. We show that generated scales can be optimized to preserve the pure-tone character of the scale by compromising the modulation/transposition properties by a least amount. The other four measures are generalizations that apply to scales generated by multiple intervals. These measures are directly applied to individual scales and numerically compared. We apply this formalism to pure intervals of import in antiquity and show that this approach yields the historically important just 12-tone system as an optimum scale. Finally, we show how this formalism can be applied to the analysis of non-standard scales.},

We have recently demonstrated that it is possible to classify keyboard temperament automatically from audio recordings of standard musical works to the extent of accurately distinguishing between six different temperaments often used in harpsichord recordings. The current paper extends this work by combining digital signal processing with semantic computing and demonstrates the use of the temperament classifier in a Semantic Web environment. We present the Temperament Ontology which models the main concepts, relationships, and parameters of musical temperament, and facilitates the description and inference of various characteristics of specific temperaments. We then describe TempEst, a web application for temperament estimation. TempEst integrates the classifier with ontology-based information processing in order to provide an extensible online service, which reports the class and properties of both known and unknown temperaments. TempEst allows users to upload harpsichord recordings, and provides them with an estimated temperament as well as other inferred characteristics of the instrument's tuning.},

abstract = {The article studies the problem of generalizing the concept of ‘diatonic scale’ for a given ambient chromatic of N tones: ‘Which subset A⊂ℤ N shall be considered as a generalized diatonic scale?’ Each generic type of well-formed scale has exactly two specific manifestations in chromatic universes, which are large ME*-scales, i.e. which are maximally even non-degenerate well-formed scales, whose cardinality exceeds half of the chromatic cardinality. A qualitative distinction between these two large ME*-scales of the same type can be comfortably made on the basis of the shuffled Stern–Brocot tree, which is introduced in Section 2. The shuffled Stern–Brocot tree represents the same abstract binary tree as the traditional Stern–Brocot tree, but has a different planar arrangement. Candidates and final choices for generalized diatonic scales are studied in Section 3. Candidates are those large ME*-scales A⊂ℤ N which are tightly generated by a prime residue class m mod N. According to this property there is no non-degenerate m-generated well-formed scale W properly included between the translation T 1(A c ) of the complement of A and A itself. This property is equivalent to the fact that the associated ratio m/N is a chromatic number, i.e. that its penultimate predecessor on the Stern–Brocot tree is a convergent for m/N, which again is equivalent to the fact that the ratio m/N corresponds to a right branching on the shuffled Stern–Brocot tree. Tight generatedness of a large ME*-scale is also equivalent to the fact that the small-scale step of chromatic size 1 is at the same time also the rarer step, while the large step of size 2 is at the same time also the more frequent step. A generalized diatonic scale A minimizes the cardinality difference between |A| and |A c | among all tightly generated large ME*-scales in ℤ N . For N divisible by 4, this definition reproduces exactly the family of hyperdiatonic scales, as studied by Agmon (Journal of Music Theory, 33(1), 1–25, 1989) and Clough and Douthett (Journal of Music Theory 35, 93–173, 1991). For N odd we exclude the trivial case of 2-generated scales and obtain a rich inventory of generalized diatonic scales, such as the 7-generated 11-tone scale in ℤ19. An interesting point for N odd is also the generalization of the tritone as a minimal limited transposition subset. We show that Ivan Wyschnegradsky has already done pioneering work on this subject (1916). His 11-generated 13-tone scale in the quarter-tone chromatic ℤ24 is a hyperdiatonic scale in the sense of Agmon (1989) and Clough and Douthett (1991) as above, and his argumentation in favour of this scale anticipates central points of the discussion in this article.},

abstract = {This essay advocates the integration of mathematical reasoning into the teaching of music theory. It offers a didactical pathway through a series of attractive results from well-known algebraic approaches to the study of diatonicity. In particular, strategies are discussed that let the students re-enact processes of investigation and discovery. The content centers around the study of intervals and chords within the diatonic scale. This involves the distinction between generic and specific descriptions, combinatorics of voice leading and chord inversion, as well as the explanatory power of the cycle of fifths. In order to reach its goals, the essay strives towards the introduction of unorthodox media, such as the Tonkreisel, the Rotating Square, or the Diatonic Cord (rope).},

abstract = {Using three criteria a desirability function is developed which allows comparison of the reasonableness of equal‐tempered musical scales to approximate just musical intervals. Unlike most other measurements, this scale is not dominated by very fine octave divisions. This feature allows for comparison of systems with few divisions to the octave with those with many divisions to the octave. Based on our measure, an equal‐tempered scale which must best represent the pure fifth requires 12, 41, or 53 notes to the octave. If the major third is to be well represented, equal‐tempered scales of 28 or 59 notes are required. Best representation of the minor third occurs for a 19‐note equal‐tempered scale. These results are shown to be in accordance with previously cited continued fraction results and other published evaluation criteria. The method is generalized to assess the reasonableness of equal‐tempered scales to approximate multiple just intervals simultaneously as well as to account for numerical weighting of intervals. Our results show that an equal‐tempered scale required to approximate the pure fifth, major third, and minor third equally requires 12, 19, 34, or 53 notes. This result is contrary to previously cited results in which 34 notes to the octave is relegated to a relatively minor role.},
